## ðŸ“Š Core Financial Health Measures

### 1. Profitability Score
**Purpose:** Evaluates company profitability using net margin and return on equity  
**Scale:** 2-10 (2 = Poor, 10 = Excellent)

```dax
Profitability Score = 
VAR NetMargin = DIVIDE(AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[net_income_millions]), AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[revenue_millions])) * 100
VAR ROE = DIVIDE(AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[net_income_millions]), AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[stockholders_equity_millions])) * 100
RETURN IF(NetMargin >= 20 && ROE >= 15, 10, IF(NetMargin >= 15 && ROE >= 10, 8, IF(NetMargin >= 10 && ROE >= 5, 6, IF(NetMargin >= 5 && ROE >= 0, 4, 2))))
```

**Business Logic:**
- Combines net profit margin and return on equity for comprehensive profitability assessment
- Score 10: Net margin â‰¥20% AND ROE â‰¥15% (exceptional profitability)
- Score 8: Net margin â‰¥15% AND ROE â‰¥10% (strong profitability)
- Score 6: Net margin â‰¥10% AND ROE â‰¥5% (adequate profitability)
- Score 4: Net margin â‰¥5% AND ROE â‰¥0% (marginal profitability)
- Score 2: Below minimum thresholds (poor profitability)

### 2. Liquidity Score
**Purpose:** Measures company's ability to meet short-term obligations  
**Scale:** 2-10 (2 = Poor liquidity, 10 = Excellent liquidity)

```dax
Liquidity Score = 
VAR CurrentRatio = DIVIDE(AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[current_assets_millions]), AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[current_liabilities_millions]))
VAR QuickRatio = DIVIDE(AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[current_assets_millions]) - AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[inventory_millions]), AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[current_liabilities_millions]))
RETURN IF(CurrentRatio >= 2.5 && QuickRatio >= 1.5, 10, IF(CurrentRatio >= 2.0 && QuickRatio >= 1.2, 8, IF(CurrentRatio >= 1.5 && QuickRatio >= 1.0, 6, IF(CurrentRatio >= 1.2 && QuickRatio >= 0.8, 4, 2))))
```

**Business Logic:**
- Evaluates both current ratio and quick ratio for comprehensive liquidity analysis
- Score 10: Current ratio â‰¥2.5 AND Quick ratio â‰¥1.5 (excellent liquidity buffer)
- Score 8: Current ratio â‰¥2.0 AND Quick ratio â‰¥1.2 (strong liquidity position)
- Score 6: Current ratio â‰¥1.5 AND Quick ratio â‰¥1.0 (adequate liquidity)
- Score 4: Current ratio â‰¥1.2 AND Quick ratio â‰¥0.8 (marginal liquidity)
- Score 2: Below minimum thresholds (liquidity concerns)

### 3. Efficiency Score
**Purpose:** Assesses how effectively company utilizes its assets  
**Scale:** 2-10 (2 = Poor efficiency, 10 = Excellent efficiency)

```dax
Efficiency Score = 
VAR AssetTurnover = DIVIDE(AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[revenue_millions]), AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[total_assets_millions]))
VAR InventoryTurnover = DIVIDE(AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[cost_of_goods_sold_millions]), AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[inventory_millions]))
RETURN IF(AssetTurnover >= 1.5 && InventoryTurnover >= 8, 10, IF(AssetTurnover >= 1.2 && InventoryTurnover >= 6, 8, IF(AssetTurnover >= 1.0 && InventoryTurnover >= 4, 6, IF(AssetTurnover >= 0.8 && InventoryTurnover >= 2, 4, 2))))
```

**Business Logic:**
- Combines asset turnover and inventory turnover for operational efficiency assessment
- Score 10: Asset turnover â‰¥1.5 AND Inventory turnover â‰¥8 (highly efficient operations)
- Score 8: Asset turnover â‰¥1.2 AND Inventory turnover â‰¥6 (strong efficiency)
- Score 6: Asset turnover â‰¥1.0 AND Inventory turnover â‰¥4 (adequate efficiency)
- Score 4: Asset turnover â‰¥0.8 AND Inventory turnover â‰¥2 (below average efficiency)
- Score 2: Below minimum thresholds (poor operational efficiency)

### 4. Growth Score Simple
**Purpose:** Evaluates company's revenue growth trajectory  
**Scale:** 2-10 (2 = Poor/negative growth, 10 = Excellent growth)

```dax
Growth Score Simple = 
VAR RevenueGrowth = DIVIDE(AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[revenue_millions]) - AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[revenue_millions]), AVERAGE('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[revenue_millions])) * 100
RETURN IF(RevenueGrowth >= 25, 10, IF(RevenueGrowth >= 15, 8, IF(RevenueGrowth >= 10, 6, IF(RevenueGrowth >= 5, 4, 2))))
```

**Business Logic:**
- Measures year-over-year revenue growth percentage
- Score 10: Revenue growth â‰¥25% (exceptional growth)
- Score 8: Revenue growth â‰¥15% (strong growth)
- Score 6: Revenue growth â‰¥10% (solid growth)
- Score 4: Revenue growth â‰¥5% (modest growth)
- Score 2: Growth <5% (stagnant or declining)

### 5. Financial Health Score
**Purpose:** Composite score combining all financial health dimensions  
**Scale:** 2-10 (2 = Poor overall health, 10 = Excellent overall health)

```dax
Financial Health Score = 
([Profitability Score] + [Liquidity Score] + [Growth Score Simple] + [Efficiency Score]) / 4
```

**Business Logic:**
- Equally weighted average of all four core financial health metrics
- Provides comprehensive assessment of company's overall financial position
- Used as primary ranking metric for executive dashboards

    TOPN(
        1,
        VALUES('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[Company Name]),
        [Financial Health Score],
        DESC
    )
VAR TopScore = 
    MAXX(TopCompany, [Financial Health Score])
RETURN 
    MAXX(TopCompany, 'financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[Company Name]) 
    & " (" & FORMAT(TopScore, "0.00") & ")"
```

### Bottom Performer

```dax
Bottom Performer = 
VAR BottomCompany = 
    TOPN(
        1,
        VALUES('financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[Company Name]),
        [Financial Health Score],
        ASC
    )
VAR BottomScore = 
    MINX(BottomCompany, [Financial Health Score])
RETURN 
    MAXX(BottomCompany, 'financial_data_export_20250611_153833'[Company Name]) 
    & " (" & FORMAT(BottomScore, "0.00") & ")"
